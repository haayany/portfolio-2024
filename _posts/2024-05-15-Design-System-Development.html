<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The company had three different channels for conducting business. Retail, Consumer-direct, and wholesale. B2C,
    retail, and consumer-direct part of the company had multiple subsidiaries that required different branding.
    Similarly, wholesale customers wanted to apply their own branding to our provided services as well.</p>

<p>Another issue with their proprietary system was front-end development speed. There were no guidelines nor component library for repetitive items, even for a button. Every button on different pages was slightly different.</p>

<h2>Primitive Tokens</h2>
<p>Based on our products’ needs and goals, I set up various tokens. As we were not using semantic tokens at the moment, the color palettes itself are following WCAG 2.0 (and 3.0 for orange tone) to deal with any kind of scenarios.</p>

<p>Typography token is using 3 different primitive tokens, font size, font weight, and line height. By doing this, each theme can be easily controlled for its purpose.</p>

<h2>Component & Semantic Tokens</h2>

<p>Figma didn’t have a native way to apply tokens properly but with limited library features. I was able to make a decent way to apply different themes with library swap feature, but it was still, too much to ask new designers who are not familiar with Figma.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Figma introduced variable feature. And I was able to update all the components with it quickly.</p>
<p>While making and applying component tokens, I realized two things; In code, token naming convention is not consistent It’s a good time to apply Semantic Tokens.</p>
<p>I grabbed front-end engineers and showed possible two naming conventions, and suggestions for applying semantic tokens for actions. Thanks to the great front-end engineering team, we connected Figma tokens to the code. Figma token update means code is updated automatically.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Product for Our Team</h2>

<p>I believe making a design system is making a product for designers and software engineers. So I did everything I could to make it convenient for them. Slot and table component is some of the my efforts to make that possible.</p>

<p>With Slot component, designers could update the contents inside of a component without disconnecting its library. (slot component concept is originally from Atlassian. See Atlassian Figma File)</p>

<p>Working on a financial product meant a lot of tables. (or a similar structure) Designers always needed to spend lots of time moving around table borders, cells, rows, and columns. After the update, designers never needed to work more than 5 minutes on any kind of updates for tables.</p>
