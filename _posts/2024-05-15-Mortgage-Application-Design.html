    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>Based on research on the existing product, its customers, other products from competitors, and mortgage rules and
        regulations, I suggested two different approaches. Updating visuals with minimal changes and overhauling the
        application. The stakeholders wanted to go with a fast way, updating visuals.</p>

    <p>Even though it was a visual update, I believed there would be some room and opportunities to make general UX
        better. I threw a presentation about some opportunities that can improve the product while updating visuals.</p>

<div class="col-md-8 mx-auto py-5">
    <h2>Information Hierarchy</h2>
    <p>Even though the originating system that was connected to the product had certain items in the same group, the
        product didnâ€™t need to follow the same grouping rule. There was a consumer report including a review of this
        product which states navigating issues.</p>

    <p>I broke down the Uniform Residential Loan Application, URLA, into several parts along with other competitors and
        ours. The flow chart was shared with any new project contributors for an easy and quick overview.</p>

    <h2>Funnel type of data entry</h2>
    <p>I have been exposed enough to understand several regulations regarding the mortgage application and some marketing techniques. Combining these two into one, I suggested gathering estimated information is better than capturing the precise information upfront.</p>

    <p>TRID rule requires lenders to provide loan estimates and closing disclosures to the borrower within 3 business days. The timer starts clocking once the borrower provides certain information. However, lenders easily guess some values of that information.</p>

    <p>
        Instead of doing that, I suggested separate data entry into two parts, assigning easy and attracting ones up-front and complicated and time consuming ones later, in another existing product, borrower portal.
