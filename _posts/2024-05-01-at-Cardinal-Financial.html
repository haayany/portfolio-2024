    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>I also led the development of a comprehensive design system that emphasized theming and a precise connection between design and code, which was utilized across five different products.</p>

    <p>My efforts in fostering a supportive environment not only significantly reduced unnecessary tasks and Figma-related inquiries but also led to the expansion of the team with three additional UX designers.</p>

    <p>
        Additionally, I served as an internal UX consultant for various features in proprietary loan origination system. Providing essential research, guidance, prototypes, and conceptual designs, contributed in the company's approach to user experience design.
